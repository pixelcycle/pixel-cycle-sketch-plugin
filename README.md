# PixelCycle Sketch Plugin

<br />

## Generate Images

Pixel Cycle lets you generate several types of **vector patterns** and backgrounds, and add them to your Sketch project.

<br />

## Installation

First, download the PixelCycle Sketch Plugin as a zip file from here:

### [Download Plugin](https://github.com/pixelcycle/pixel-cycle-sketch-plugin/blob/master/pixelcycle.sketchplugin.zip?raw=true)


Then, **unzip** that file, and **double click** on the `pixel-cycle.sketchplugin` file to install.

<br />

## Using the Plugin

Once installed, open the plugin in Sketch by going to `Plugins` > `PixelCycle` > `Add Image`
