# PixelCycle Sketch Plugin

<br />

## Generate Images

Pixel Cycle lets you generate several types of **vector patterns** and backgrounds, and add them to your Sketch project.

<br />

## Installation

First, download the PixelCycle Sketch Plugin as a zip file from here:

### [Download Plugin](https://github.com/pixelcycle/pixel-cycle-sketch-plugin/blob/master/pixelcycle.sketchplugin.zip?raw=true)


Then, **unzip** that file, and **double click** on the `pixel-cycle.sketchplugin` file to install.

<br />

## Using the Plugin

Once installed, open the plugin in Sketch by going to `Plugins` > `PixelCycle` > `Add Image`

Then you can browse the image categories:

<br />

And then choose and insert an image into your Sketch file

## Adjusting the Images

Before you download each image, you have the ability to edit the image.  Each image type has different settings that you can adjust to make the image fit your needs.
